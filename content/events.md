   image: images/events/bbq.jpg
   description: "brings together Singaporeans from throughout the greater Boston
   area for an evening of food and networking. Grab a few moments to relax just
   as the school term gets going and before work starts piling up. Enjoy
   Singaporean food on America's favorite cooking implement - the grill!"

 - name: Kopitiam

   description: "is an annual culinary showcase of the best Singaporean food in
   Boston. Authentic favorites are cooked and prepared entirely by MIT students
   and affliates who have a passion for cooking. The event is an opportunity for
   volunteers to learn the art of cooking and for participants to sample the
   diverse food culture of Singapore. Kopitiam is also promoted as the annual
   fundraising event of the MITSSS. It is a huge draw for Singaporeans from all
   over Boston and attracts over 200 students annually. Dishes include chilli
   crab, chicken rice, and katong laksa."

   the Chinese calendar. It is an occasion for friends and family to gather

   Year every year, bringing together Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans alike in
   an environment where CNY is not commonly observed."

 - name: The Seniors' Farewell Party

   best in their future endeavors. It is usually held around the last week of

   friends."

 - name: National Day

   members and friends. The celebration is usually held in the second or third

   celebration) is an event of catered food, late-night mahjong, and catching up
   with friends."
