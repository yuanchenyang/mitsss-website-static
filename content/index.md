Founded in 1986, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Singapore Students
Society (MITSSS) is a MIT-registered student group that seeks to foster
friendship and promote cultural exchange between Singaporeans and members of the
MIT community. The MITSSS is active in the Greater Boston area, and organises
annual events and meetups for the Singaporean community at large.

The process of signing up as a member of the MITSSS is free of
charge. Membership is not limited to Singaporeans or MIT students; it is open to
anyone with an interest in Singaporean culture.
